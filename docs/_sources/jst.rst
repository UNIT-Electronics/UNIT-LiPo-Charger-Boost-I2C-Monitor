Connecting the JST SH 1.0mm 4 terminals connector
=================================================

Stemma QT, Qwiic, and other I2C modules work with the JST SH 1.0mm 4-pin connection. This setup simplifies development board and device connections. Qwiic connects devices without soldering and works with the JST SH 1.0mm 4-pin connection.

The connection lets developers easily add sensors, actuators, and other peripherals without soldering, reducing connectivity mistakes.

The tiny, user-friendly connector organizes device connections with a lower footprint.
Interoperability makes Gamma compatible with many devices and development platforms.

.. note:: 

    The JST SH 1.0mm 4 pins connector is compatible with Cocket Nova developed board.
